#Course Project#
1. In this repo, I use data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
2. then I merged the training and the test sets to create one data set
3. I extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
4. I Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. I appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names
6. Finally I created an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
the R script I used is named **run_analysis.R** and the codebook is named **CodeBook.md**

PS. for the script to properly run, the folders: test and train from the data should be in R folder
