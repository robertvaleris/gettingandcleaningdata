the R script called "run_analysis.R" creates a txt file called "getdataproject.txt" in R folder. This file is
a table containing the following variables:

**subject:** with values from 1 to 30, these are the individuals who participated in collecting data from Samsung galaxy S.

activity: each subject collected data in each of these activities: walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting,
laying, standing.

std_body_accelero_X: standard deviation of body acceleration signal along X axis (g units)

mean_body_accelero_Y: mean body acceleration signal along Y axis (g units)

std_body_accelero_Y: standard deviation of body acceleration signal along Y axis (g units)

mean_body_accelero_Z: mean body acceleration signal along Z axis (g units)
